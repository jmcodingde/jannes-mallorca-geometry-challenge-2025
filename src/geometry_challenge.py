def calculate_length_r(alpha_degrees: float, n: float, g: float, i: float, j: float, k: float, s: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the length of side r based on the given angle alpha and constants.

    Args:
        alpha_degrees (float): The angle alpha in degrees
        n (float): Constant n from the construction
        g (float): Constant g from the construction
        i (float): Constant i from the construction
        j (float): Constant j from the construction
        k (float): Constant k from the construction
